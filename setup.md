# Setting up an environment

## Set up environment locally using a conda environment file

To get the correct libraries and versions it is recommended that the provided conda environment is used. To create and activate the titanic environment:

1. Download the environment.yml file

2. Windows -> Open Anaconda prompt. Mac/linux -> Open a terminal

3. Run the following command: `conda env create -f environment.yml`

This will fetch and install the libraries in a conda environment 'multiclass'

4. To activate the environment run the following command:
    `conda activate multiclass`
